## 1. Directory Contents

This directory stores the binary artifacts generated by the training pipeline. These files are the "Deliverable" of the MLOps process.

| File | Description | Loader |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `model.joblib` | The trained **RandomForestRegressor**. Contains all tree structures and leaf weights. | `joblib.load()` |

> **Note**: The `preprocessor.joblib` (Scaling/Encoding logic) is stored in `data/processed/` as it is tightly coupled to the data transformation stage, while `model.joblib` is the final inference engine.

---

## 2. Versioning & Lineage

These artifacts are track by **Git** (only the placeholder `.gitignore`) and **DVC** (the actual binaries).

* **Code**: `training/train.py` defines *how* valid models are created.
* **Data**: `dvc.lock` defines *what data* trained this specific binary.
* **Params**: `params.yaml` defines *what hyperparameters* were used.

This triad ensures that any `model.joblib` can be exactly reproduced.

## 3. Usage

### Loading in Python

```python
import joblib

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('models/model.joblib')

# Make a prediction
# Input must be a 2D array matching the training feature shape
prediction = model.predict(X_new)
```

### Compatibility

* Built with Scikit-Learn `1.4+`.
* **Warning**: Joblib files may be incompatible across different Python/Scikit-Learn versions. Verify `requirements.txt` matches your environment.
